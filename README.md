# IIFE returning objects and functions

To run this you will need node installed and run `node app.js`

Nothing too complex going on here just calling an IIFE which returns two functions `purchaseCoke` `invalidFundsError`
If a number passed as an argument is less than 2 then the error func is returned else another message is printed.
